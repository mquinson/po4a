.CELLS ALIGNED HORIZONTALLY, VERTICALLY, AND ACROSS A SPAN OF THREE COLUMNS
[cols="3"]
|===
^|PREFIX THE `{VBAR}` WITH `{CARET}` TO CENTER CONTENT HORIZONTALLY
<|PREFIX THE `{VBAR}` WITH `<` TO ALIGN THE CONTENT TO THE LEFT HORIZONTALLY
>|PREFIX THE `{VBAR}` WITH `>` TO ALIGN THE CONTENT TO THE RIGHT HORIZONTALLY

.^|PREFIX THE `{VBAR}` WITH A `.` AND `{CARET}` TO CENTER THE CONTENT IN THE CELL VERTICALLY
.<|PREFIX THE `{VBAR}` WITH A `.` AND `<` TO ALIGN THE CONTENT TO THE TOP OF THE CELL
.>|PREFIX THE `{VBAR}` WITH A `.` AND `>` TO ALIGN THE CONTENT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CELL

3+^.^|THIS CONTENT SPANS THREE COLUMNS (`3{PLUS}`) AND IS CENTERED HORIZONTALLY (`{CARET}`) AND VERTICALLY (`.{CARET}`) WITHIN THE CELL.

.BUILDING A VARIETY OF CELL SPECIFIERS
|===

2*>m|THIS CONTENT IS DUPLICATED ACROSS TWO COLUMNS.

IT IS ALIGNED RIGHT HORIZONTALLY.

AND IT IS MONOSPACED.

.3+^.>s|THIS CELL SPANS 3 ROWS. THE CONTENT IS CENTERED HORIZONTALLY, ALIGNED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CELL, AND STRONG.
e|THIS CONTENT IS EMPHASIZED.

.^l|THIS CONTENT IS ALIGNED TO THE TOP OF THE CELL AND LITERAL.

v|THIS CELL CONTAINS A VERSE
THAT MAY ONE DAY EXPOUND ON THE
WONDERS OF TABLES IN AN
EPIC SONNET.

.CELLS WITH ASCIIDOC IN THEM
[cols="2"]
|===

a|THIS CELL IS PREFIXED WITH AN `A`, SO THE PROCESSOR INTERPRETS THE FOLLOWING LINES AS AN ASCIIDOC LIST.

* LIST ITEM 1
* LIST ITEM 2
* LIST ITEM 3
|THIS CELL *IS NOT* PREFIXED WITH AN `A`, SO THE PROCESSOR DOES NOT INTERPRET THE FOLLOWING LINES AS AN ASCIIDOC LIST.

* LIST ITEM 1
* LIST ITEM 2
* LIST ITEM 3

a|THIS CELL IS PREFIXED WITH AN `A`, SO THE PROCESSOR HONORS THE `LEAD` STYLE ON THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH.

[.LEAD]
I AM A PARAGRAPH STYLED WITH THE LEAD ATTRIBUTE.
|THIS CELL *IS NOT* PREFIXED WITH AN `A`, SO THE PROCESSOR DOES NOT HONOR THE `LEAD` STYLE ON THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH.

[.LEAD]
I AM A PARAGRAPH STYLED WITH THE LEAD ATTRIBUTE.
