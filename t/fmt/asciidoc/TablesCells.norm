.Cells aligned horizontally, vertically, and across a span of three columns

|===
^|Prefix the `{vbar}` with `{caret}` to center content horizontally

.^|Prefix the `{vbar}` with a `.` and `{caret}` to center the content in the cell vertically

|===

a|This cell is prefixed with an `a`, so the processor interprets the following lines as an AsciiDoc list.

* List item 1
* List item 2
* List item 3
|This cell *is not* prefixed with an `a`, so the processor does not interpret the following lines as an AsciiDoc list.

* List item 1
* List item 2
* List item 3

a|This cell is prefixed with an `a`, so the processor honors the `lead` style on the following paragraph.

[.lead]
