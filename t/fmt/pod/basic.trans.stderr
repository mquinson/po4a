po4a::pod: A new SimplePod parser is now available.  Please consider using it instead of the current Pod module. If you encounter any bugs, your reports would be greatly appreciated.  To use it, add the following line at the top of your po4a configuration file: "[po4a_alias:Pod] SimplePod".  You can disable this message by setting the no-warn-simple option.  Sorry for the noise, and thank you!
