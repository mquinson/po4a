 \ V /| |_| | / /  ___) |
  \_/  \___(_)_/  |____/          June 17. 2024.
  
César-François Cassini de Thury was born 310 years ago, and then made
a bunch of nice-looking topographic maps of France and around.

General:
 * Try to not fail when writing UTF po files with old Perl versions
   (GitHub's #495) [Ineiev].
 * Improve various error messages to help users debugging encoding issues.

   The thing is that po4a v0.70 and later is much more picky about encodings.
   Before, it was relying on the default Perl behavior to do "the right thing",
   happily parsing latin-1 or UTF-8 files and converting to the Perl internal
   string representation. The drawback was that this setup forced po4a to
   convert back and forth internally after reading and before writing.

   The v0.70 code uses PerlIO to handle all encoding issues automatically,
   removing all manual conversions in the code of po4a. The price for this is
   that users must specify the used encoding more precisely (I sometimes
   suspect that previously, user settings were only used as an hint of the
   actual conversion, not a ground truth). So the users are now more exposed
   to the mess of Perl encodings, where utf8 and UTF-8 are actually different.
   https://perldoc.perl.org/Encode#UTF-8-vs.-utf8-vs.-UTF8

   This new behavior broke the build of several Debian packages. In some cases,
   it was just the result of po4a being less forgiving about user configuration
   (eg, Debian's #1072643). In Debian's #1073038, it was that po4a made a
   difference between utf8 and UTF-8 in the encoding specification embedded in
   a POD file. There is no such difference in this context, only in Perl
   internals: utf8 is lax parsing while UTF-8 is picky parsing, but both lead
   to the same result if the file is correctly encoded following the UTF-8
   standard. po4a now takes UTF-8 (picky parsing) in both cases for POD files.

 \ V /| |_| | / /| |_| |
  \_/  \___(_)_/  \___/           (Released on 2024/01/29)

Major cleanup: 
 * Greatly simplify the code by using PerlIO instead of messing up 
   with encodings manually.
 * This is a very intrusive change, and even if all tests of our 
   comprehensive suite pass, I still expect issues with this on some
   corner cases, such as projects not using UTF-8 but a mixture of 
   encodings. Please report any issue, and accept my apologies.
 * This greatly simplifies the code, enabling future maintenance.

Asciidoc:
 * Correctly handle lines that start with a dot in a paragraph.
   Thanks Jean-Noël Avila for the pull request.
 * Labels of cross-references were not translatable (GitHub's #400).
   Thanks Jean-Noël Avila for the pull request.
 * Fix a bug in the handling of the 'id' attribute (GitHub's #411).
   Thanks Jean-Noël Avila for the pull request.
 * Process multi-line attributes in legacy and asciidoctor mode
   (GitHub's #414). Thanks Jean-Noël Avila for the pull request.
 * Process transparent index entries in their own segments
   (GitHub's #424). Thanks Jean-Noël Avila for the pull request.
 * Keep original formating (GitHub's #416). Thanks suddenfall for
   the feedback, and Jean-Noël Avila for the fixes.
 * Fix a bug in handling of bold text starting a list item
   (GitHub's #447). Thanks Jean-Noël Avila for the pull request.
 * Fix handling of linebreaks in lists (GitHub's #444). Thanks
   Jean-Noël Avila for the pull request.

Tex:
 * Allow verbatim environment declaration without trailing space
   (GitHub's #407). Thanks Mayeul Cantan for the report & the fix.
 * Informative error message when file not found for \input, indicating
   how to skip this include (GitHub's #421) [mquinson].

Texinfo:
 * Translate partial menu node names (GitHub's #437) [Apteryks].

Markdown:
 * Treat link reference definitions as no-wrap (GitHub's #422) [gemmaro].
 * Don't emit a warning when provided an empty tag list in YFM
   (GitHub's #426) [Martin].

YAML:
 * Verbosely fail on inline lists and dictionaries, as YAML::Tiny does not
   handle them as lists or dicts anyway. Do quote list-looking strings
   (GitHub's #439) [Martin & gemmaro].

General:
 * Don't fail on empty po files, e.g. adoc files containing only
   includes. Thanks Suddenfall for the report & fix (GitHub's #408).
 * Fix an encoding error in one file which resulted in build errors
   with new gettext versions (GitHub's #428).
   Thanks to Jan Palus for the issue report and the fix.
 * Use the semantic of Perl v5.12 (released in 2012) instead of the previously
   requested one (v5.6 release in 2000). This is to request the unicode_strings
   feature, making the utf strings more predictable.
 * Accept BOM markers at the beginning of files (GitHub's #443 and #333) [Mt]
 * Specify in the README.md and in all source files that the license is GPL2+,
   not GPL2-only (GitHub's #434) [Mt]

Documentation:
 * Improve the description of the internals, in the hope that potential
   contributors will become proficient quickly and help us. [Mt]
 * Revamp the po4a(7) document now that the po4a-* scripts are deprecated.
   Explain why they are, and don't mention them in the described workflow.
   (Debian's #1036824). [Mt]

po4a main script (the deprecated po4a-* scripts are still buggy):
 * Deal properly with CRLF files coming from windows (GitHub's #409).
 * Allow to escape spaces in file names, or to quote them (GitHub's #412).
 * Do not pass empty PO files to msgmerge, as it stumbles on such things when
   the POT file has UTF chars in the msgids. (GitHub's #442) [Mt]

po4a-translate:
 * Remove the wrap-po option that was not used internally.

po4a-updatepo:
 * Do not pass empty PO files to msgmerge, as it stumbles on such things when
   the POT file has UTF chars in the msgids. (Debian's #1022216) [Mt]

Build scripts:
 * Use xmlcatalog(1) to find DocBook XSL file (GitHub's #431).

Markdown:
 * Parts of a fenced divs are now translated separately (GitHub's #381)

YAML and Yaml Front Matter:
 * Use the implementation of YFM to parse YAML files too.
   - This reduces the code dupplication, and brings the nice features over:
     Numbers and arrays are not quoted anymore in Yaml files, as it should be.
   - This adds the yfm_paths option to Markdown and Asciidoc YFM,
     fixing GitHub's #392 along the way.
   - Please note that '-o keys' is now case-sensitive in Yaml documents.
 * Do not translate nor quote booleans, so that they are not treated as string.
   Thanks Gissmo for GitHub's PR #393, even if I had to rework it quite a bit.

XML:
 * Correctly handle placeholders of empty elements (GitHub's #389)
 * Translate attributes within attribute-folded inline and placeholder (GH #391)
   alt attribute of <img> can be properly handled with:
   -o 'attributes=<image>alt' -o 'inline=<image>' -o foldattributes
 * Thanks k-yaegashi for the pull request fixing both issues

Project organization:
 * Do not leak the generation date in our manpages (GitHub's #387)
   Thanks Arnout Engelen for the pull request.

  \_/  \___(_)___/ \___/          (Released on 2022/09/04)


 This release dedication is here to remind you that Hope is always important.
 Plus, the song of that name by Pink Floyd also deserves a dedication.

Project organization:
 * Add a deprecation warning to po4a-translate and po4a-updatepo stating
   that po4a is the prefered interface.
 * Rewrite the po4a-gettextize documentation (Debian's #1016695) [Mt].
 * Rewrite the intro of po4a doc, and add a Quick start tutorial [Mt].

gettextization:
 * Rework completely the deduplication of msgids introduced in v0.67.
   - Instead of adding spaces and require the users to merge them
     manually after an extremely painful analysis of the produced file,
     automatically merge the msgstr together.
   - The result will look something like:

     #, fuzzy
     msgid "hello"
     msgstr ""
     "#-#-#-#-#  file reference 1 (type: Title #)  #-#-#-#-#\n"
     "HELLO\n"
     "#-#-#-#-#  file reference 2 (type: Title ##)  #-#-#-#-#\n"
     "SUBTITLE\n"

   - Closes Debian's #1017742, that was asking for help in the review [Mt].

Markdown:
 * Allow lists to start the line with no leading spaces before the '-'
   sign (Github's #378). This uncovers a bug in our test suite that
   was enforcing the buggy behavior :( [Mt]
 * Properly deal with fenced div blocks (Github's #381) [Mt]

Man:
 * Bold text should never be wrapped as groff seems to reset the font
   on new line (Debian's #1016753) [Mt].
 * Properly deal with comments around macro definitions [Mt]
   (Debian's #1017837).

   paranoid OSes (GitHub's#327 -- thanks newbluemoon for report and fix).

AsciiDoc:
 * Accept numbered list items beginning with any number of dots
   (GitHub's #210)

Markdown:
 * Avoid translating Markdown fenced code block info string (GitHub's #194)
 * List Markdown fenced code block info string as text type (GitHub's #195)
 * Support YAML Front Matter (GitHub's #196). This requires YAML::Tiny.
 * Introduce options yfm_keys and yfm_skip_array to respectively
   specify which YAML keys should be translated, and that the array
   content should not be translated.
 * Work around a bug in YAML::Tiny that quotes numbers (GitHub's #217)
 * Add gettext flag "markdown-text" for relevant entries (GitHub's #208)

Text:
 * Honor the (existing) --neverwrap option to handle every content verbatim.

Texinfo:
 * Add the comments starting with 'TRANSLATORS:' to the po file
   (GitHub's #162)

XHTML:
 * Don't fail nor warn when a closing tag is missing, that's legit in HTML.
   (GitHub's #179)

XML and DocBook:
 * Allow attributes with no value (GitHub's #178).
 * Processing Instructions are handled as inline tags by default, but
   you can change them back to breaking with '-o break-pi' (GitHub's #170)

Yaml:
 * Introduce option to skip array values. (GitHub's #187)

po4a tool:
 * Cleanups and fixups about options' parsing (now tested and documented)
     _
    / \  You may need to upgrage your po4a.conf if you were using
   /_!_\ "unwanted features" (ie, bugs) of the previous implementation.

 * Do not touch source dir when --destdir is provided (Debian #602387)
 * Pass --add-location=file to msgmerge when receiving option porefs.
   (requires gettext >= 0.19 -- June 2014)
 * Option --master-charset sets the charset of the generated POT file.
 * Option --master-language sets the language of the generated POT file.
 * Add support for addendum path in po4a_paths (Debian #823189)
 * Stop pretending that --porefs can control the wrapping of reference
   comments, as the gettext tools used internally always rewrap them.

Scripts:
 * Rename po4aman-display-po to po4a-display-man
 * Rename po4apod-display-po to po4a-display-pod

Core:
 * Use UTF-8 by default (the 20th century is over -- Debian #862460)
   po4a used to prefer ascii unless it proved impossible. But the
   underlying detection would fail, possibly for document containing
   UTF-8 chars composed on printable ascii chars only.
 * Add a --wrap-po option to control how the po file is wrapped, and
   chose between either nicely wrapped files that tend to produce git
   conflicts, or ugly files that are easy to automatically deal with.

Tests:
 * Completely refactor most tests. They are now more reliable and the
   error messages are much more useful to understand the issues.
 * Many bugs to po4a and the core were ironed out in the process.
 * PO files content are now tested too (GitHub's #67)

Documentation:
 * Various cleanups by Golubev Alexander (GitHub's #190 & #191)

Yaml:
 * Fix the behavior with utf-8 files, thanks to Zero King (GitHub's #112)
 * Add the references from the Yaml file to the po file (GitHub's #117)
   Thanks Zero King.

Texinfo:
 * Fix handling of spaces in menu descriptions (Github's #122 and
   Debian's #758851).

Text:
 * Fix the parsing of fortunes files, which had been broken since
   v0.43. The handling has changed a bit, all msgids are now marked as
   "no-wrap", because the word wrap in fortunes files usually matters.
 * Remove the option for parsing AsciiDoc. There has been a standalone
   module for nearly five years, released with v0.45. The AsciiDoc
   option for the Text module has been deprecated since then.
 * Support pandoc's bibliographic information (title, author, date)
   at the beginning of a markdown file. Also fix a trailing newline
   in some markdown titles (Debian's #894977).

Man:
 * Support .MT and .ME macros for e-mail address markup (Debian's #900965).
 * Support .OP, .SY, and .YS macros for command synopses.

Asciidoc:
 * Fixed a bug that prevented the asciidoc module to parse correctly four
   characters table marks.

Documentation:
 * Fix many typos and other issues found by Yuri Chornoivan (GitHub's #104)
   and Allan Nordhøy (GitHub's #102) while translating.
 * Remove the last references to the alioth servers and mailing lists.

po4a tool:
 * po4a --keep-translations will not remove your existing translations
   if they fall below the threshold. It won't create badly translated
   files either. Use it if you prefer outdated but translated doc to
   updated but not translated doc.

po4a-build tool:
 * Remove it and all related shell scripts and makefile chunks. It is
   deprecated by the po4a tool since a long time, and I could not find
   any usage of po4a-build either in Debian or using search engines.

Translations:

general:
 * The "type:" comments in the PO files are now tagged as extracted
   comments (starting with #.). This changes all the PO files generated by
   po4a. Maintainers should just let these changes pass through.
   Translator may want to remove the comment lines starting with '# type:'
   as they will be duplicates with the '#. type:' comments.

Xml:
 * Placeholders are presented with a type and have a more valid XML
   representation. This changes the PO files, but translations could be
   updated automatically.
 * Do not fail when the doctype does not match the expected one. Only
   issue a warning.
 * The tags and tagsonly options are deprecated. Use the
   translated/untranslated and break/inline/placeholder options instead.
 * Added foldattributes option. Useful to simplify strings and avoid typos
   when attributes shall not be translated.
Man:
 * Better handling of spaces in command arguments.
TeX:
 * Included files are searched with kpsewhich instead of using TEXINPUTS
   directly.

po4a
 * Added support for the [po_directory] command in the configuration file.
   It permits to avoid listing the supported languages.  Simply dropping a
   new PO file should be sufficient.  It should be preferred over the
   po4a_langs and po4a_paths commands.
po4a-normalize:
 * Added option -b, --blank to check which parts of a document are not
   translated.
po4a-gettextize:
 * Improved conflict handling: indicate the reference of the alternatives
   when the same string has different translations.

general:
 * Added support for a nowrapi18n option in Locale::Po4a::Common in
   order to use Locale::Po4a programatically.

packaging:
 * Manpages are generated in utf-8. This requires a recent Pod::Man with
   support for the utf8 option.

 * Improved support for Docbook 5 and Docbook 4, based on the official
   documentation of the Docbook tags.
Pod:
 * Announce the encoding in the POD header.
Sgml:
 * Add support for recursive inclusion.
Text:
 * Added option asciidoc
Xhtml:
 * Improvements for the <u> tag.
xml:
 * Fix the nodefault option. Derivative modules should use _default_tags
   and _default_inline to define the default behavior of their
   module-specific tags (instead of tags and inline).
 * Speed improvements.
 * Added support for placeholders.

Notes to packagers: Since 0.31, some tests in the sgml testsuite require
the docbook sgml DTD. If you run the testsuite at build time you must have
these DTD in your build dependencies or you must disable these tests
cases in the testsuite.

** New features
  general: Support for PO files with plural forms.
           Po4a does not generate such PO files, but it can receive one in
           input. In such case, po4a cannot choose between the (singular
           and) plural forms. It will consider that msgstr[0] is the
           translation of msgid and msgstr[1] is the translation of
           msgid_plural, which may be wrong. Thus, a warning will be
           issued if po4a is asked to translate the singular or plural
           form of a message with plural forms.

  texinfo: Major changes. Tested on the elisp documentation.

  sgml: Fail if nsgmls cannot validate the input file. This can be turned
        off with the "force" option.

  xml: New option "cpp" to support C preprocessor directives (this avoids
       re-wrapping lines with preprocessor directives).
  xml: New options "translated" and "untranslated" that should allow an
       easier configuration of Xml (and derivative module)
  xml: Avoid duplicated newlines at the end of lines of multi-lines
       comments.
  xml: Paragraphs which only consist in an inline tag are now extracted.
       This makes a lot of string to available for translation in the PO
       file.
  docbook: Tested on the Docbook testsuite. Lots of tag added.

  po4a: Fix failures with perl 5.10. Thanks to Roderich Schupp
        <roderich.schupp@googlemail.com>

  msguntypot: Fix handling of the comment of the PO header.

** Security fix
  Fix a symlink attack caused by the /tmp/gettextization.failed.po
  temporary file.
  (CVE-2007-4462)

** Bug fixes

  sgml: The handling of newlines was broken in no-wrap sections in 0.31

  xhtml: The module is now distributed as the other modules.

  texinfo: Fix infinite loop when a command parameter ends with \
           (as in @samp{\})

** New features

  xml: New option includeexternal to support external entities.

  texinfo: Added support for many commands and environment (see
           changelog).

  xhtml: New option includessi, which adds supports for Server Side
         Includes include element (<!--#include virtual="/foo/bar.html" -->).

  xml: New option ontagerror to control the behavior of the module in case
       of error. This permits to support files that the module would
       consider invalid otherwise.

** Translations

  New translations (Bengali, Estonian, Croatian, Indonesian, Kannada,
  Korean, Occitan, Uzbek, Simplified Chinese, Chinese from Hong Kong) and
  many updates.

** Dependencies

  po4a,
  po4a-updatepo: New option --previous requires gettext 0.16.

** Bug fixes

  general: Don't hang when running in background with redirected stdout.
           Thanks to Jim Meyering.

** New features

  general: po4a now uses timestamps to avoid re-generating a translation
           if no changes are expected: if a translation is more recent
           than its associated PO, master document, addenda or
           configuration file, then there is no need to update it. For the
           documents which do not pass the translation threshold, a
           --stamp option was added to tell po4a to create files with a
           .po4a-stamp extension (you can also create them manually).
           This can save a lot of time when po4a knows that the
           translation will not be generated because there were no changes
           since the last po4a run.

  general: Beginning of a C extension. This provides speedup. Testers are
           welcomed.

  po4a: New options: --msgid-bugs-address and --copyright-holder.

  po4a: Add new tag: [options] to set global options (i.e. for every
        documents in the configuration file).

  po4a: Update translations based on modification times. Use timestamp to
        avoid retrying generate uncompleted translations.

  man: New 'unknown_macros' option to specify the behavior of po4a with
       unknown groff macros.

  man: Reset the configuration between two runs. This permits to define
       different options for different files in a config file with the
       opt:"..." parameters.

** Bug fixes

  man: Recode the text which is skipped, like comments.
       This kind of issue may also appear on other modules.
       A better solution would be to always use UTF-8 internally.

  distribution: Some unit tests were missing.
                Also, the dependencies have been simplified.
                Locale::gettext, Text::WrapI18N, Term::ReadKey and SGMLS
                are still recommended, but no more required.
                The BibTex module is now distributed.

  sgml: The module should be more friendly with XML files.

  po4a: When po4a creates a new PO file, it now uses msginit. This may
        change the header of created PO files.

  guide: Major update of the tag definitions. Thanks to Azamat H.
         Hackimov.

  Po: use strftime instead of date because date is not available on
      every platform.

  tests: rename the XML testsuite to SGML, since it was testing the Sgml
         module, and add a new testsuite for the Xml module (it currently
         tests the Guide module).

** Bug fixes

  sgml: Remove the tags from the default categories when they are defined
  by the user.  This changes the behavior of the Sgml module's options.

  sgml: Better line references in the generated PO.

  sgml: Support for '/>' (empty XML tag closure) when an xml prologue is
  found (<?xml ...?>).

  po4a: When po4a create new PO files, it now uses msginit instead of
  copying the POT file.

  man: Keep empty commented lines.

  man: Do not add spaces at the end of lines.

  man: Languages without non breaking space could not use question marks.

  sgml: Better support for verbatim sections, and consider <cmdsynopsis>
  as verbatim. <arg> and <option> are now in the ignore category.

  general: Length calculation algorithm changed for wrapping lines in the
  output document or in the PO. This should improve output when files are
  encoded in UTF-8.
