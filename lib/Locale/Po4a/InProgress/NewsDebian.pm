=head1 NAME

Locale::Po4a::NewsDebian - convert NEWS.Debian documents from/to PO files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The po4a (PO for anything) project goal is to ease translations (and more
interestingly, the maintenance of translations) using gettext tools on
areas where they were not expected like documentation.

Locale::Po4a::NewsDebian is a module to help the translation of the
NEWS.Debian files into other [human] languages. Those files are where
maintainer are supposed to write the important news about their package.

=head1 OPTIONS ACCEPTED BY THIS MODULE

NONE.

=head1 STATUS OF THIS MODULE

Not tested.

A finer split of the entries may be preferable (search for /^ */, for
example), but this version is more robust and NEWS.Debian entries are not
supposed to change that often.
