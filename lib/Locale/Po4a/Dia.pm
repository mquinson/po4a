=head1 NAME

Locale::Po4a::Dia - convert uncompressed Dia diagrams from/to PO files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The po4a (PO for anything) project goal is to ease translations (and more
interestingly, the maintenance of translations) using gettext tools on
areas where they were not expected like documentation.

Locale::Po4a::Dia is a module to help the translation of diagrams in the
uncompressed Dia format into other [human] languages.

You can get Dia (the graphical editor for these diagrams) from:
  http://www.gnome.org/projects/dia/

=head1 TRANSLATING WITH PO4A::DIA

This module only translates uncompressed Dia diagrams.  You can save your
uncompressed diagrams with Dia itself, unchecking the "Compress diagram
files" at the "Save Diagram" dialog.

Another way is to uncompress the dia files from command line with:
  gunzip < original.dia > uncompressed.dia

=head1 STATUS OF THIS MODULE

This module is fully functional, as it relies in the L<Locale::Po4a::Xml>
module. This only defines the translatable tags (E<lt>dia:stringE<gt>), and
filters the internal strings (the content of the E<lt>dia:diagramdataE<gt>
tag), not interesting for translation.
